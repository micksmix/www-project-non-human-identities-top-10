| Successfully exploiting a Long-Lived Secret requires the threat agent to first gain access to the secret value. Therefore, Long-Lived Secret attacks depend on a separate initial access vector. | Long-Lived Secrets are extremely common in modern environments. This is due to the challenges associated with rotation and low availability of ephemeral solutions. Detecting Long-Lived Secrets is easy given the majority of secret managers enable users to see the amount of time that has passed since rotation. | Secrets tend to hold credentials for high-impact NHI (such as API Keys and Database connection strings).|


## Description

Long-lived Secrets refers to the use of sensitive NHIs such as API keys, tokens, encryption keys, and certificates with expiration dates that are too far in the future or that don’t expire at all. Developers frequently use these secrets to enable applications to authenticate and interact with various services and resources within an organization. Oftentimes, these secrets can be breached or leak (see [Secret Leakage](https://owasp.org/www-project-non-human-identities-top-10/2025/2-secret-leakage/)). If a breached secret is long-lived, it provides attackers with access to sensitive services without any time constraints.

## Example Attack Scenarios

* **Privilege Escalation via Stale Sensitive Access Token:** An attacker with low-level privileges in the corporate network identifies a year-old data dump. The dump contains a sensitive Access Token with admin privileges. The attacker leverages the sensitive Access Token to raise privileges in the network.
* **Session Hijacking via Stolen Long-Lived Cookies:** A web session cookie is set to be long-lived. An infostealer campaign dumps cookies from one browser in the corporate network. The infostealer then sells that cookie to an attacker who leverages the session cookie to breach the corporate network.

## How To Prevent

* **Enable Automated Key Rotation:** Automating the rotation of API keys or credentials using cloud-native tools or simple scripts reduces manual effort and ensures credentials are not long-lived.
* **Implement Short-Lived Credentials:** Many cloud platforms like AWS and Azure provide built-in mechanisms to use temporary credentials that automatically expire and refresh after performing the task they made for. 
* **Adopt Zero Trust Principles:** Require re-authentication for NHIs accessing sensitive resources or performing high-risk actions.
* **Enforce Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for the NHI to perform its tasks, reducing the impact of credential compromise.
